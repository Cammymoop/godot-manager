# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## Version 0.1.1

- Removed GDScript Addon for Notes as is not needed in the Release of Godot Manager.
- Fixed Listing of projects, so now they are properly sorted by Favorites, as well as last access time.
- Fixed minor bug with View Selector, not properly updating the first icon when it is clicked.
- Special thanks to [Mo8it](https://github.com/Mo8it) for correcting major spelling issues within the documentation, and the code.
- Fixed visibility of category lists, so that they now properly display when Godot Manager re-opens.  (If a category is collapsed, it will remain collapsed)
- Fixed Minor bug in New Project dialog, that didn't properly detect an empty directory as a valid directory in which to create a project in. (Function was still outputting values for '.' and '..' directory markers.)
- Added Changelog to help keep a clean spot for updates, changes, and additions to the code.

## Version 0.1.0

This is the Initial Release of Godot Manager
